In addition, we will hold meetings where we will learn the principles of South Asian poetry styles, like nazm, ghazal, etc. The name of the club is inspired by the moniker given to one of the most revered Pakistani poets, Muhammad Allama Iqbal, who was often referred to by Westerners as the \u201cPoet of the East\u201d. Though South Asian and Persian poetry are our points of interest, we are open to the full span of Asian poetry culture being represented."

Therefore they are an ethnoreligious group. Their language is still in use today in the Coptic Orthodox Church. Members will learn about Copts and participate in activities that are related to the Coptic Culture and Heritage.

                "The purpose of this club is to serve as a chapter of Project HOPE, a charitable organization that partners with communities, healthcare systems, and physicians to heal people and save lives, while empowering healthcare workers to create a healthier, more equitable world. Project HOPE responds to a wide array of international and domestic healthcare issues, including current infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases, health inequities, natural disasters, global health insecurity, and maternal and neonatal health. As a chapter, we want to support Project HOPE\u2019s mission by hosting monthly workshops with visitor Project HOPE speakers and doctors to educate the student community at Hunter College and expose pre-health students to the field. We hope to endorse equity, diversity, and inclusion in healthcare by hosting campaigns and fundraisers to directly assist in change and innovation, by creating a monthly newsletter for members, and by allowing students to volunteer for the cause (and receive a letter of reference from the organization)."

The club aims to empower (social work) students in balancing the stressors of academic courses with the demands of field placement by supplying a forum for collaboratively engaging with mindfulness practices, such as meditation and yoga. We wish to expose social work graduate students to a range of traditional and not-so-traditional techniques that may not be covered in regular coursework. This goal is currently accomplished through weekly meetings, largely centered around guided meditations and shared resources. The alliance provides an opportunity for students with similar interests to meet, practice self-care and share relevant ideas and information."

Project HOPE responds to a wide array of international and domestic healthcare issues, including current infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases, health inequities, natural disasters, global health insecurity, and maternal and neonatal health. As a chapter, we want to support Project HOPE\u2019s mission by hosting monthly workshops with visitor Project HOPE speakers and doctors to educate the student community at Hunter College and expose pre-health students to the field. We hope to endorse equity, diversity, and inclusion in healthcare by hosting campaigns and fundraisers to directly assist in change and innovation, by creating a monthly newsletter for members, and by allowing students to volunteer for the cause (and receive a letter of reference from the organization)."

Students will be able to learn some of the Francophone language and delve into holidays, cuisine, traditions, media, and customs within these Francophone nations and their history. One of the running themes and major points would be that France is not the only country that speaks French, hence the indication that it has a Francophone culture. That being said, this club will focus on traditions from Francophone countries all over the world. Another purpose of this club will be to offer the chance to experience Francophone culture in NYC through excursions. The goal of this club is to educate and excite students about the Francophone culture and language."

In addition, we will hold meetings where we will learn the principles of South Asian poetry styles, like nazm, ghazal, etc. The name of the club is inspired by the moniker given to one of the most revered Pakistani poets, Muhammad Allama Iqbal, who was often referred to by Westerners as the \u201cPoet of the East\u201d. Though South Asian and Persian poetry are our points of interest, we are open to the full span of Asian poetry culture being represented."

Therefore they are an ethnoreligious group. Their language is still in use today in the Coptic Orthodox Church. Members will learn about Copts and participate in activities that are related to the Coptic Culture and Heritage.

                "The purpose of this club is to serve as a chapter of Project HOPE, a charitable organization that partners with communities, healthcare systems, and physicians to heal people and save lives, while empowering healthcare workers to create a healthier, more equitable world. Project HOPE responds to a wide array of international and domestic healthcare issues, including current infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases, health inequities, natural disasters, global health insecurity, and maternal and neonatal health. As a chapter, we want to support Project HOPE\u2019s mission by hosting monthly workshops with visitor Project HOPE speakers and doctors to educate the student community at Hunter College and expose pre-health students to the field. We hope to endorse equity, diversity, and inclusion in healthcare by hosting campaigns and fundraisers to directly assist in change and innovation, by creating a monthly newsletter for members, and by allowing students to volunteer for the cause (and receive a letter of reference from the organization)."
