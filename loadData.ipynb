       "  'club_description': ['Our focus will be the study, recitation, and historical examination of South Asian and Persian poetry. I intend to make it light-hearted and easy to understand. We will try to enjoy ourselves with events like mushairas (which is an open forum to present poetry that members have written or read), poetry slams, and nature walks. In addition, we will hold meetings where we will learn the principles of South Asian poetry styles, like nazm, ghazal, etc. The name of the club is inspired by the moniker given to one of the most revered Pakistani poets, Muhammad Allama Iqbal, who was often referred to by Westerners as the “Poet of the East”. Though South Asian and Persian poetry are our points of interest, we are open to the full span of Asian poetry culture being represented.'],\n",
